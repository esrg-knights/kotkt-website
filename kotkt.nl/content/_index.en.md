Eindhovens Studenten Rollenspel Genootschap Knights of the Kitchen Table, or more frequently called Knights is the student board- and roleplaying game association of Eindhoven. Do you love boardgames, or do you rather let your imagination run in a good roleplaying game? Then we are the place to be!

Every week multiple boardgames are being played. Well known games such as Catan and Ticket to Ride, but also lesser known games such as Race for the Galaxy, Book of Madness, Kingsburg, Terraforming Mars and over 250 others.

We also feature several bi-weekly roleplaying campaigns as well as a one-shot roleplaying evening every first Wednesday of the month.

This all takes place from our own association room, in the Luna building on the TU/e campus. In this room members are often playing a boardgame, a roleplaying game, PC gaming or just casually hanging around during both afternoon and evenings.

### Association activities

Tuesday and Wednesday are our own activity evenings. On these evenings, starting at 19:30, the association organises general activities for all members. Every Tuesday is boardgame night where boardgame fans are united over the large collection of games.

The Wednesday evening activity changes depending on which week it is. Principally, every first Wednesday of the month is an Open Roleplay Evening. On this evening we play one-shot tabletop roleplaying games; at the beginning of the evening, players get pitched a problem or scenario they need to solve during the session. Under supervision of a Story Teller, who describes all thing that happen during the session, players try to solve the problem or at least try to make it less worse. At the end of the evening the story concludes.

On the 4th Wednesday of the month our Tea@ takes place, where our most experienced Story Tellers give advice to other ST's about improving your Story Telling skills (e.g. in regards to ambiance, monsters and character creation). Other Wednesdays have an ever changing nature which is shared every month to the association through our internal calendar. These evenings can vary from theme-nights, a Christmas Dinner, lasergaming and more.

Do you want to get a taste of our association? Then please join us on one of our Boardgame or Roleplaying Evening!

Always wanted to go wild without repercussions? Try a roleplaying game!

In (tabletop) roleplaying games, you envision yourself as a different character whom, along with others goes on a yourney guided by a story teller (also known as Dungeon Master or story leader). This ST describes everything and everyone you encounter along the way. From the deep caves of Ckbaktar, the empty galaxy on your way to Alpha Centauri or the abandoned village of your family. The world is unlimited, the possibilities unrestrained.

### Oneshot Roleplaying

One-shots are roleplaying games which consist of only one session. At the end of the session the story is concluded (happy endings not guaranteed).

Every 1st wednesday of the evening we host a one-shot roleplay evening. Here multiple of our ST’s present their story concepts which they will ‘run’. Members then decide with whom they want to join. Want to try it yourself? Drop by for free to experience the taste of adventure!

### Roleplay Campaigns

The Knights host multiple continuous campaigns. These are running stories spread over multiple (often bi-weekly) sessions.

On the beginning of every semester (early september, end of februari) a Looking for Group is hosted. On this evening players looking for a campaign and Sts looking for players are united. The (new) campaings will then search for a common date on which all players can unite for the remainder of the campaign.

The association tries to give every running campaign a space in Luna where the campaign can be hosted.

At the Knights there are also fans of Life Action Roleplaying, more commonly known as LARP. A Larp is similar to tabletop roleplaying, where instead one describes to do actions, one actually uses the entire body to simulate the event happening.

Twice-yearly we host our own one-shot LARPs which take place during our own association weekends. Every member gets a unique character in the world, varying from fairytale figures during a quarantine to survivors of a destroyed cruiseship. Furthermore our association aids in making and expanding LARP costumes. Every 1st Sunday of the month the Brass Scissors order is present where members can go to for aid in where one can buy the best material, as well as working and sowing the materials together to form your LARP costume.

### Larp Swordfighting Practice

Whenever it is warm enough in spring, summer and autumn, the Knights host a bi-weekly LARP swordfighting practice on the thirsday. With aid of the foamrubber LARP swords, training will be given on using the swords in a save, but visually cool way in whatever swordfighting match your characters would be part of.

### Haven Larp

We also have a larp written by our own talented Orange Clockmakers:

It’s the year 2999. Mankind has had its ups and downs. In which state it is now, depends on your
social position and group. Not because life is inherently good for one and bad for others, but
because your position and group determine how much you can determine about your own life.

### Fantasy Court

The Knights also organize the yearly Fantasy Court Festival, which expresses the Fantasy and LARP culture. During this festical several LARP associations, LARP-clothing and attribute stands will be present as well as boardgame, music, dance, a swordfighting tournament and more. Stay tuned by visiting the website or following them on facebook.

      Boardgame evening
      Every Tuesday
      19:30 
   {{< /banner >}}
{{</ aside >}}

Every tuesday evening we host boardgame evening where many of our members drop by for a fun game. This can be any of our many short games such as the Big Dalmuti and Fantasy Realms, or normal length games such as Suburbia, Catan, Dominion and Dungeon Lords to the 3 hour games such as Nations, Terra Mystica, and Battlestar Gallactica the boardgame. These evening start at 19:30. It’s best to arrive before this time as late arrival can result in all players already playing a game.

Is one evening not enough to saturate your lust for strategy? No worries. Many of our members also play during the afternoons and other evenings. One of the advantages of having our own space; the games are always waiting to be played.

For some, even this can not be nough. Therefore, at the end of every TU/e quartile there is a long boardgame day where you can play games all day long, or just one long game of 4+ hours such as Twilight Imperium or the Game of Thrones boardgame.

Still haven’t had your fix? Maybe you’re up for a 12+ hour boardgame such as Virgin Queen or Here I Stand. Although you may want to choose a date yourself in summer- or christmas break.

Are you interested in knowing all of the boardgames we have at the Knights and can be played by members of the Knights? Take a look at our [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/KotKT).
