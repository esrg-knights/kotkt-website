As with everyone we have to deal with COVID-19 and we have created guidelines to ensure our activities can take place safely.
You can find these guidelines [here](https://beta.kotkt.nl/nextcloud/s/JpGkgdMLCGX4nHL/download).
Please read them before joining an activity.
Part of these guidelines is that **you are required to sign up** for these activities. Non-members can sign up [here](https://forms.gle/f1kBn4c8SWdf1GBQ9)


### Tuesday 9th of September 19:30: Boardgame Evening

Every week the Knights organize a Boardgame Evening where we play boardgames together.

For more info on boardgames, [see the main site](/en/#boardgames)

### Wednesday 10th of September 19:30: Tabletop Roleplay Evening

Once a month the Knights organize a Tabletop Roleplay Evening where our storytellers prepare a one-shot session.
They set up a roleplaying system (think Dungeons & Dragons, Fate or others), characters and together you play through a story.
These sessions run for a night and at the end of the night the story ends as well, so you don't need to commit to a campaign if you join this activity.

We do host roleplay-campaigns though, if you are interested in them talk to a board member or send a mail to info@kotkt.nl

### Thursday 11th of September 19:30: LARP Swordfighting training

Every two weeks the Knights organize a LARP-Swordfighting training.
In this training you play with LARP-safe swords.
As this is the first training of the year, we'll focus on beginners as well. 
So if you have never held a sword before, this is your chance!

Next to these swordfighting trainings we host a few LARPs as well, for more information on that [see the main site](/en/#larp)

### Can't come?

That's unfortunate, but not a big issue, as these activities are very similar to our normal activities.
If you are considering joining the Knights feel free to join one of our normal activities, the first few activities you join are free.
For more information on our normal activities, [see our main site](/en) or [our calendar](https://app.kotkt.nl/calendar/).

In any case, don't forget to subscribe [here](https://forms.gle/f1kBn4c8SWdf1GBQ9) if you do plan on coming!
